# React Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from functional components. React gives us some built-in hooks that we’ll take a look at shortly, but we can also create our own custom hooks that will allow us to reuse/share stateful logic.

## Benefits of Hooks
* Let you use more of React’s features without classes (state and an alternative to lifecycle methods)
* Let you organize the logic inside a component into reasonable isolated units
* Allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy
* Will likely reduce your bundle size because code using Hooks tends to minify better than equivalent code using classes
* No breaking changes
